Methods are basically a function which are written inside a class.
Any variable defined inside class will be defined inside a special function called __init__(constructor)

constructor is also known as magic method/dunder

magic-method :--> Automatically called if certain conditions are met


self is defined as the object to which you are currently working.
(Jis bhi object ke saath aap abhi kaam kar rahe ho wahi self hain)

__str__(),__add__()

Any variable created inside the constructor is called the instance variable.Because the value of these variables are
different for different objects.

For  making an variable private in python we will use __ in front of variable name. E.g. __pin,__balance

Nothing in python is truly private.if we define any variable private in python we can still access it by using
object._ClassName__VariableName

Don't allow your data to be directly accessed.This is the main concept of encapsulation.We can make the getter 
and setter function for accessing and changing the value of data.
