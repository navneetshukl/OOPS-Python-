Methods are basically a function which are written inside a class.
Any variable defined inside class will be defined inside a special function called __init__(constructor)

constructor is also known as magic method/dunder

magic-method :--> Automatically called if certain conditions are met


self is defined as the object to which you are currently working.
(Jis bhi object ke saath aap abhi kaam kar rahe ho wahi self hain)

__str__(),__add__()

Any variable created inside the constructor is called the instance variable.Because the value of these variables are
different for different objects.

For  making an variable private in python we will use __ in front of variable name. E.g. __pin,__balance

Nothing in python is truly private.if we define any variable private in python we can still access it by using
object._ClassName__VariableName

Don't allow your data to be directly accessed.This is the main concept of encapsulation.We can make the getter 
and setter function for accessing and changing the value of data.

                           ### Reference variable ### 

sbi=Atm()  here sbi is refernce variable.
At the time of creating object the variable which point to the address where the object is created that variable
is known as the reference variable.


                            ### Pass_By_reference ###

Objects of class are also mutable like lists,dictionaries and sets.

                            ### Static variable ###

Static variable is created outside of the constructor.A static variable is said to be a 
class variable that is common to all class members.We can access the static varoiable by using the class name.
We can make the static variable unaccessible by using "__" in front of static variable name like __static.variable. 
We can make getter and setter for accessing the value. We will not pass "self" in getter and setter methods
because the static variable will use classname.
